                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Judith Mason and I run Bluebell Therapy, offering <a href="/counselling.html">counselling</a> and <a href="/hypnotherapy.html">hypnotherapy</a>. My practice
                            room is in Beeston, Nottingham, where I live with my family and a couple of well-behaved pets. I trained to be a therapist after many years experience in the teaching profession.
                            In both my careers, I have been motivated by wanting to help and support people to reach their personal potential.
                            I still work with young people and now offer therapy to clients of all ages. I am also a Senior Lecturer, teaching and mentoring
                            trainee therapists for Chrysalis Courses, have experience as a secondary school counsellor and
                            offer occasional mental health <a href="/workshops.html">workshops</a>.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I work with a local charity offering weekly group sessions on emotional wellbeing as well as individual counselling sessions.</p>
                        <p>Many people are nervous when starting therapy - it can feel like a huge step. My role is to ensure that you feel as comfortable as possible
                        and I am happy to have an initial chat with you by phone or email before arranging to meet up, if you choose to do so. I work in an integrative way, using
                         different therapeutic tools to help you gain an understanding of the issues you have, helping you to move forward. From our initial conversation
                          onwards, anything that we discuss is entirely confidential whether you choose to continue or not.</p>
