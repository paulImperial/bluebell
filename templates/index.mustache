                        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Judith Mason and I run Bluebell Therapy, offering <a href="/counselling.html">counselling</a>, <a href="/hypnotherapy.html">hypnotherapy</a> and <a href="/supervision.html">clinical supervision</a> in Beeston, Nottingham.
                         I trained to be a therapist after many years experience in the teaching profession.
                        In both my careers, I have been motivated by wanting to help and support people to reach their personal potential.
                        I have some experience as a secondary school counsellor and still work with young people, as well as adults of all ages.
                        In addition, I work with a local charity offering a weekly programme on emotional wellbeing, as well as individual counselling sessions.
                        Outside of my clinical work, I am also a Senior Lecturer for Chrysalis Counselling Courses, and offer occasional mental health workshops with a colleague</p>
                        <p>Many people are nervous when starting therapy - it can feel like a huge step. My role is to ensure that you feel as comfortable as possible
                        and I am happy to have an initial chat with you by phone or email before arranging to meet up, if you choose to do so. I work in an integrative way, using
                         different therapeutic tools to help you gain an understanding of the issues that you face, and helping you to move forward. From our initial conversation
                          onwards, anything that we discuss is entirely confidential whether you choose to continue or not.</p>
